# Life Safety Keypad/Display KPDISP  

# Overview  

The KPDISP is a combination keypad and dot-matrix display designed for use with the EST3 integrated system. The unit features a large LCD display and telephone-style keypad housed in an attractive Cycoloy  case. A removable cover is provided to prevent accidental keypad activation and protect against dirt.  

The KPDISP transmits and receives information from/to the EST3 system. Communications between the KPDISP and the EST3 are fully supervised, providing the ultimate in reliability. KPDISP data is stored in non-volatile memory. Power to the KPDISP is provided by the EST3, ensuring a reliable, supervised and backed-up power source.  

The KPDISP supports bilingual operation, and can be programmed to automatically display the language of the user.  

The display is backlit, and lights whenever a key is pushed. An automatic timer extinguishes the light after a brief delay. The keypad features tactile and audible feedback and is backlit at all times. To aid in locating the keypad in the dark, the back lighting is visible even with the cover closed.

# Application  

The KPDISP is a full-function life safety annunciator used to display fire alarm events. It’s unobtrusive design blends with any decor, while its pass code function permits only authorized users to retrieve system information.  

Each of up to 200 authorized users is assigned a pass code consisting of a unique three-digit number and a four-digit PIN number. Duplicate PINs are permitted by the KPDISP, so a user can pick a number that is easy for them to remember.  

All operations are menu-driven. In the event of a problem, contextsensitive help is readily available using a dedicated HELP button.  

# Installation  

The KPDISP is designed to facilitate installation in a wide variety of indoor applications. The unit can be mounted directly on a wall or using a $4^{\ast}$ or 100mm square or 2-gang electrical box. To ensure reliability, terminal blocks are provided for all wiring. One pair carries data in and out of the unit, while the second pair provides power. These specially-designed terminal blocks provide unique features aimed at maintaining system operation during commissioning or servicing. Should a KPDISP be removed from its rear mounting plate, the terminals automatically provide continuity to downstream devices. This helps ensure continued communication with the control panel, despite the removal of a KPDISP from the communication wiring path. The unit features electronic addressing so there are no jumpers or switches to set in the unit.
