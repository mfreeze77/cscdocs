The unit can be mounted directly on a wall or using a $4^{\\ast}$ or 100mm square or 2-gang electrical box. To ensure reliability, terminal blocks are provided for all wiring. One pair carries data in and out of the unit, while the second pair provides power. These specially-designed terminal blocks provide unique features aimed at maintaining system operation during commissioning or servicing. Should a KPDISP be removed from its rear mounting plate, the terminals automatically provide continuity to downstream devices. This helps ensure continued communication with the control panel, despite the removal of a KPDISP from the communication wiring path. The unit features electronic addressing so there are no jumpers or switches to set in the unit. ",
