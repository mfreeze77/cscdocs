# FireWorks Incident Management Platform  

# Overview  

FireWorks is an incident management command and control platform that comprises hardware, software, and networking components that together provide a powerful and cohesive Mass Notification and Life Safety solution. Sophisticated networking technology allows it to integrate seamlessly with EDWARDS life safety solutions, yet FireWorks remains fully interoperable with third-party equipment, making it ideal for system upgrades or new installations alike.  

FireWorks can automatically trigger programmed responses to facility events, or it can act as an operator interface for manual control. The FireWorks user interface provides a clear, concise, and coordinated view of any situation by presenting information strategically.  

Five configurable graphical viewports offer simultaneous insight into different aspects of an incident, while the underlying software dynamically manages content in each viewport based on real-time events and user interaction. Facility maps, live video feeds, audio channels, protocol information, and fingertip control over vital equipment all come together instantly within view of an operator facing events that require solid information and split-second timing.  

Supporting every FireWorks workstation is a sophisticated network backbone—strong enough to handle coordinated critical control functions from as many as fifty client workstations and many other devices, yet flexible enough to manage integration with third-party mass notification systems.  

Redundant server options eliminate risk of communications breakdowns by providing alternate data paths that regenerate communications in the event of signal loss. FireWorks can operate on an existing local area network, or provide facility access from anywhere in the world via secured Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections.

# Application  

# Scalable Third-party Integration  

FireWorks is equipped with a powerful HTML/HTTP/HTTPS/XML Command Processor that supports integration for Distributed Recipient Mass Notification Systems (DRMNS) and many other third-party systems. It can also receive information from third-party systems by way of the FW-DARCOM (with Bosch D6600) option and/or with the MN-NETRLY4 input/output modules.  

FireWorks systems can send certain UL 2572 V1, Technical Category TC1, TC2, TC3 and TC4 outputs to third-party systems by way of the MN-FVPN VoIP, MN-NETRLY4 and/or SignatureSeries modules. The EDWARDS APS6A can be easily configured to support most third-party interfaces.  

# Dynamic Viewports  

# Image Viewport:  

Displays images relevant to the occurrence. Any event, any device, or any combination of devices and events can retrieve instant graphical information that is relevant to the occurrence and can be understood Event List Viewport: Upon receipt of a change of state, the event information is displayed in the Event List Viewport. If several events are received, all events are displayed in the Event List viewport

# Flexible Email Messaging  

To enhance off-premise notification, FireWorks supports connection to a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail server, allowing event information to be emailed. This provides the ability to get event information automatically, efficiently and inexpensively to the people who need to know about events in facilities.  

Email messages can be configured based on individual events, event categories and more. Certain people can receive all system events, others can receive only alarm conditions, while still others can receive only specific events—the options are easy to configure and also to change.  

# Valuable Reporting Functions  

FireWorks report functionality allows the system administrator or other authorized user to create and retrieve panel reports. Reports include Panel Status, Disabled Points and Sensitivity. Meanwhile, a full history report generator allows the review of historical panel events.  

the system to have anywhere from two to five viewports visible  

overview of the event’s location in the context of its surroundings and the entire facility.  

tion, the Browser Viewport can be configured to automatically connect to emergency information sites, network accessible building automation, video streams, and other thirdparty systems.  

how to respond to the selected event, and also to acknowledge that these instructions have been carried out.  

FireWorks has a versatile Devices Test Report. This report allows for devices that have been tested as part of a Service Group to be included in a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Fire Alarm And Signaling Code (NFPA 72) formatted report.

Example UL Listed Mass Notification: Scalable Third-party Integration  

# FW-FAST: Automatic System Configuration  

FireWorks Assimilation Systems Technology can significantly reduce the time and expense of programming or modifying a FireWorks system database. This unique and powerful option reads properly formatted AutoCAD and EDWARDS System Definition Utility (SDU) files to automatically create floorplans with device locations, and panel renderings with pseudo point touchsensitive areas. Floorplans and panel renderings can then easily be inserted into the FireWorks system.  

# FW-HSSX1: Aspirated Detection Interface  

FireWorks Highly Sensitive Smoke Detector (HSSD) interface provides UL Listed/FM Approved digital command/control integration with Xtralis VESDA® Series smoke detectors for very early fire detection. FireWorks can respond to individual sector/pipe conditions, detector events, as well as minor and major faults across 20 VESDA nodes encompassing as many as 2,000 VESDA detectors. It can also reset and perform certain other control functions of the VESDAnet detectors.

# FW-DARCOM: Third-party Interoperability  

This option allows for a FireWorks system to support Digital Alarm Communicator Receiver (DACR) operation. The DACR can be any Bosch D6600 DACR that can receive Security Industry Association (SIA) Contact ID or 4/2, or the cost-effective IPMON1000 option. The FW-DARCOM option with the D6600 allows FireWorks to receive, display and process information from most third-party fire alarm and/or security panels.  

# IPMON1000: Life Safety Integration  

When used in conjunction with FW-DARCOM software, this option supports digital connection to up to a total of 1,000 EDWARDS iO Series control panels for receive-only Contact ID operation. Each individual zone or addressable device can display on the FireWorks system.  

# WebClients: Global VPN Communications  

FireWorks systems support an optional real-time WebClient remote read-only text viewing feature that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via a secured Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection, or local network connection. WebClient events mirror the FireWorks system Event List and Event Action viewports. These events are prioritized and color-coded for easy identification by type and source. Events may also be filtered at the Web Client, and sound files can be added per alarm, supervisory, trouble or monitor event category.  

Any number of remote web clients can be deployed by FireWorks. The number of concurrent connections possible is determined by the package option. The WebClient can also run many reports for the remote workstation and print them to a local printer or output them to a .csv file.
