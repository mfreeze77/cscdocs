The transmitter emits an invisible infrared light beam that is reflected via a reflector mounted directly opposite and within a clear line of sight. The reflected infrared light is detected by the receiver and analyzed. Smoke in the beam path will reduce the received infrared light proportionally to the density of the smoke. The detector analyzes this attenuation and initiates an alarm condition when a predetermined level of obscuration is reached. ",
