# Auxiliary Power Supplies APS6A, APS10A  

# Overview  

The Auxiliary Power Supply (APS) is a UL 864, 9th Edition listed power supply. It is a 24 Vdc filtered-regulated, and supervised unit that can easily be configured to provide additional notification appliance circuits (NACs) or auxiliary power for Mass Notification/ Emergency Communication (MNEC), as well as life safety, security, and access control applications.  

The APS contains the circuitry to monitor and charge internal or external batteries. Its steel enclosure has room for up to two 24 ampere-hour batteries. For access control-only applications, the APS can support batteries totaling up to 65 ampere-hours in an external enclosure. The APS has four Class B (convertible to two Class A) NACs. These can be activated in one or two groups from the APS’s unique dual input circuits. The APS has a doormounted AC power indicator LED.  

The APS also has room for and can power a number of different modules.  These can be Signature AA-30 or AA-50 dual-channel audio amplifiers, SIGA-UIO modules and/or SIGA-RELs.  A MN-BKRT3 can also be installed.  This bracket can accommodate an MN-NETSW1 Ethernet network switch, an MN-FVPN VoIP moduleand a MN-COM1S Communications module  

The APS is available in 6.5 or 10 ampere models. Each output circuit is has a capacity of three amperes; total current draw cannot exceed the unit’s rating.

# Application  

The APS provides additional power and circuits for notification appliances and other 24 Vdc loads. It is listed for indoor dry locations and can easily be installed where needed.  

Fault conditions are indicated on the on-board diagnostic LEDs, opening the BPS input sense circuit and the trouble relay (if programmed). While this provides indication to the host system, the APS can still be activated upon command. A separate AC Fail contact is available on the APS circuit board, which can be programmed for trouble or AC Fail. There are seven on-board diagnostic LEDs: one for each NAC fault, one for battery fault, one for ground fault, and one for AC power.  

The unique dual-input activation circuits of the APS can be activated by any voltage from 6 to 45 VDC (filtered-regulated) or 11 to 33 Vdc (full-wave rectified, unfiltered). The first input circuit can be configured to activate 1-4 of the four possible outputs. The second input circuit can be configured to control circuits 3 and 4. When outputs are configured for auxiliary operation, these circuits can be configured to stay on or automatically deactivate 30 seconds after AC power is lost. This feature makes these circuits ideal for door holder applications. The APS also has a separate 200 mA 24 Vdc output that can be used to power internal activation modules.  

APS NACs can be configured for a 3-3-3 temporal or continuous output. California temporal rate outputs are also available on certain models. This makes the APS ideal for applications requiring signaling rates that are not available from the main system.  

In addition to the internally generated signal rates, the APS can also be configured to follow the coded signal rate of the main system NACs. This allows for the seamless expansion of existing NACs.  

At the top of the steel enclosure, the APS has space and mounting bosses for:  

Up to two SIGA-AA30 or SIGA-AA50 dual-channel audio amplifiers  

•	 One MN-BRKT3 with one MN-NETSW1 Ethernet switch, one MN-FVPN VoIP module, and one MN-COM1S communication module •	 One SIGA-UIO6 or SIGA-UIO6R module motherboard •	 Up to two SIGA-UIO2R module motherboards •	 Up to two SIGA-REL releasing modules •	 Up to two SIGA MP2L mounting plates modules  

The above devices are in addition to the three factory-installed Signature module mounting brackets to the right of the APS circuit board.

# NAC wiring notes:  

1.	 A trouble on the APS is sensed on the existing control panel’s NAC circuit causing a NAC trouble on that panel. This removes the need to separately monitor the trouble contact except for AC power failure (see [3] below). In an alarm condition, the APS allows NAC current to move downstream to devices connected to the existing control panel’s NAC circuit.   
2.	 Refer to the connected control panel’s documentation for more details on NAC wiring.   
[3]	 The AC power failure panel connection annunciates at the panel but does not report off premises for a predetermined time period in U.S. fire applications.  

# Trouble relay wiring with four AUX circuits  

When all four NAC/AUX circuits are configured as AUX circuits and DIP switch SW2-6 is ON, a SIGA-CT2 module must be used to monitor the sense 1 trouble contacts and the trouble relay.
