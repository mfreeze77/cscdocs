# Two- and Four-Wire Head & Terminal Base Smoke Detectors 700 Series  

# Overview  

700 Series conventional photoelectric smoke detectors are interchangeable head and base detectors with a light-scattering optical sensors that provide outstanding stability and excellent response to a wide range of fires.  

A pulsed infrared LED light source and a high-speed photodiode sensing element are housed in an omnidirectional sensing chamber protected by an insect screen. For easy cleaning, the detector features a field-replaceable optical chamber.  

Model 721UT photoelectric detectors include integral fixed temperature and rate-of-rise heat detectors. The 721UT provides remote alarm and trouble LED driver outputs. Also available is the 713-5U electronic heat detector head for areas too dusty for smoke detection.  

700 Series smoke detectors were the industry’s first conventional self-diagnostic detectors specifically designed for the demands of commercial and industrial environments. If the detector drifts out of its UL Listed sensitivity range or fails internal diagnostics, the alarm LED flashes once a second to indicate a trouble condition. This meets NFPA 72 field sensitivity testing requirements without the need for external meters.  

Additional diagnostic information is activated by applying a magnet near the detector’s integral reed switch. This initiates a self-diag­nostic routine and provides visual indication of sensitivity level, or if service is required. The magnet test causes the LED to blink. The number of blink counts corresponds to a smoke detector sensitivity range.  

And, if they become dirty over time, the 700 Series detectors automatically adjust the alarm threshold through built-in drift compensation. If the detector ever does need to be cleaned, the patented field replaceable optical chamber makes cleaning a snap.

# Engineering Specifications  

The 700 Series photoelectric smoke detector, is a low-profile, selfdiagnostic, two-wire detector that monitors its own sensitivity and operational status. The detector meets NFPA 72 field sensitivity testing requirements without the need for external meters. Built-in drift compensation automatically adjust the sensitivity if the detector gets dirty. The 700 Series features an alarm verification feature to further reduce the chance of a nuisance alarm. Normal sensing occurs every 9 seconds. This rate doubles when a signal exceeding the alarm threshold value is sensed. Two additional successive signals above the threshold level initiate an alarm. The patented optical sensing chamber is field replaceable, allowing quick and easy cleaning and maintenance.  

A manually operated switch between terminals 1 and 2 establishes continuity across the alarm initiating circuit at initial installation of the base simplifying testing without the smoke head in place. The switch automatically opens when a detector head is plugged in.
