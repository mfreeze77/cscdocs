# Application  

National fire codes generally require voice evacuation systems in places of assembly with over 300-person occupancy, in theatres with more than one screen, and in buildings seven stories or higher. ANS Series Audio Notification Systems represent an effective and efficient solution for meeting these requirements.  

ANS systems are ideal for new applications with fire control panels that do not provide integrated audio functions. These audio systems also provide the opportunity to add voice evacuation capability to existing fire alarm applications without replacing existing fire alarm control equipment.  

The fire alarm control panel works in concert with the ANS audio system, providing all initiating circuitry and a signaling circuit that connects to the ANS. The ANS provides its own internal supervision as well as supervision for its speaker lines.  

Faults are reported back to the fire alarm control panel by means of a supervisory circuit, which is connected to a matching EOLR on the ANS. Internal failures and speaker line faults open a contact, which the fire alarm control panel reports as an open fault on the supervisory circuit.  

A digital message repeater (DMR) is built into all ANS systems unless ordered without the DMR. Up to 20 minutes of custom messages can be uploaded in the field with the use of a laptop and the ANSCONFSOFT1 configuration software. In addition, the selection from eight available alarm tones, automatic message repeats, AC fault report delay, and connected equipment settings are all field-configurable.  

The paging microphone is an integral component of the audio notification system. Removal of the microphone from the panel will cause a Trouble condition. This is reported locally, as well as through the fire alarm control panel.  

All ANS panels include a 120 V, 60 Hz supply (standby batteries are required). Optionally, ANS panels can be powered with 24vdc from the fire alarm control panel or a booster power supply. Where speaker-strobes are used, strobe power is provided by the fire alarm control panel or a booster power supply.

# Accessory Equipment Zone Splitter  

![](images/10e58a2794da933b714fb7030b408faf38ab40d7c0da6860c44efc3e99116ddd.jpg)  

The ANSZM4B2A Zone Splitter Module is used to enable the output of the ANS25, ANS50 or ANS100 to be split into multiple circuits for audio power distribution. The module accepts input from the ANS speaker output and utilizes output relays to distribute the power to separate circuits. The module may be cascaded to increase the number of circuits, and provides supervision of the individual circuits for either open or short conditions. Indicator LEDs display active or fault conditions for the individual circuits. A fault condition is reported to the ANS via the I2C communication port. The Zone Splitter Module may also be used with legacy ANS models, but in these cases supervision must employ TB2 Terminals 10 - 11 as a supervisory input.  

If Manual control of the circuits is required, an ANSSW8 must be employed. Zones may then be selected manually by switches or through pull-down inputs. In the event of an alarm condition, the module defaults to an All-Call. All-Call feature may only be overridden if accompanying panel has zone control features.

The ANSSW8 is an optional control/indication module that includes eight momentary contact switches and eight tri-color (green/red/amber) LEDs. Switches may be programmed for paging, emergency message activation, or control functions. When used in conjunction with the ANSZM4B2A Zone Splitter, the ANSSW8 may be programmed for zone paging. LEDs for switches assigned to page zones will indicate steady red for Page and flashing red for Alarm. An emergency message broadcast to any zone will indicate green. The zone LED will indicate amber if the associated speaker zone is in fault condition.  

Switches programmed for messages indicate Green when selected. Only one message is active at a time. If a higher priority message is activated while a message is playing, its associated LED will go off and the higher priority message LED will indicate. A fire alarm condition will override all other messages in the queue and the associated fire alarm message will be broadcast immediately.  

Switches may alternately be programmed for control functions. On a switch activation, a corresponding point on an ANSXM8 Output Card will follow. Switch LEDs indicate red on activation.
