# Fire Alarm Stations 270 Series  

# Overview  

EDWARDS 270 Series Non-Coded Fire Alarm Stations are sturdy, attractive, and designed for economical installation.  

The station is available in the following operational and functional designs:  

—	The 270 Series provides a single action, break glass initiating station. It is available with normally open (N.O.), normally closed (N.C.) or combination N.O./N.C. contacts. The basic 270 Series have screw terminals for field connection. The 270A Series Manual Stations have 6 inch (150mm) wire leads. —	The 270P Series is a break glass, normally open pre-signal station. The pull of the lever sounds an alarm on all pre-signal indicating devices. Inserting a key and turning it will initiate a general evacuation alarm. Screw terminals are provided for field connection.  

All non-coded stations are designed for either flush or surface mounting. For flush mounting a 4 inch standard North American square box with single gang plaster cover should be used. For surface mounting the 270 Series or 270P Series, use P-027193 Cast Box, P-039250 Steel Box Housing for weatherproof enclosure.
