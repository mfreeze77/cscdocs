# Harsh Environment Strobes 405-3A, -5A, -6A, -7A -8A CS405-7A, -8A  

# Overview  

405 Series strobes are specially designed for use with compatible life safety communication and control equipment to alert the hearing impaired of a life safety event.  Strobes are available with 15 cd, 15/75 cd, 30 cd, 60 cd, and 110 cd effective flash intensity. They are fully compatible with Genesis signals.  

405 Series strobes exceed UL synchronization requirements (within 10 milliseconds other over a two-hour period) when used with a separately-installed G1M Signal Master, or SIGA-CC1S Synchronization Module, or when powered by suitably enabled booster power supplies and control panels.  

The flash from 405 Series strobes can be noticed from almost any position in the room, corridor, or large open space. 405 Series strobes are UL 1971 listed with both wall and ceiling cd intensity ratings (see Specifications). This is useful in areas where the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) permits ceiling-mount strobes.  

405 Series strobes are designed for 16 to 33 Vdc operation and must be connected to signal circuits that output a constant (not pulsed) voltage. A diode is used to allow full signal circuit supervision and polarized connections are made to terminals that accept up to #12 AWG (2.5mm²) wire.  

The strobe front plate is of steel construction finished with durable baked epoxy polyester powder-coat paint.  

# Standard Features

# Application  

NOTE: The installation of visible signals are subject to national and local standards, codes, and ordinances.   
Consult your Authority Having Jurisdiction for device installation requirements, application standards, and minimum performance specifications.  

EDWARDS strobes are UL 1971-listed for use indoors as wallmounted public-mode notification appliances for the hearing impaired. Prevailing codes require strobes to be used where ambient noise conditions exceed specified levels, where occupants use hearing protection, and in areas of public accommodation. Consult with your Authority Having Jurisdiction for details.  

As part of the Enhanced Integrity line of products, 405 Series strobes exceed UL synchronization requirements (within 10 milliseconds other over a two-hour period) when used with a synchronization source.  Synchronization is important because a small portion of the population have a condition which may cause them to become disoriented from multiple random flashes of light. Integrity strobes minimize this risk.  

Integrity strobes are fully compatible with EDWARDS Genesis signals.  

NOTE: The flash intensity of some visible signals may not be adequate to alert or waken occupants in the protected area. Research indicates that the intensity of strobe needed to awaken $90\%$ of sleeping persons is approximately 100 cd. EDWARDS recommends that strobes in sleeping rooms be rated at at least 110 cd.  

WARNING: These devices will not operate without electrical power. As fires frequently cause power interruptions, further safeguards such as backup power supplies may be required.

# Current Draw Notes and Comments  

1.	 Current values are shown in mA.   
2.	 UL Nameplate Rating can vary from Typical Current due to measurement methods and instruments used.   
3.	 EDWARDS recommends using the Typical Current for system design including NAC and Power Supply loading and voltage drop calculations.   
4.	 Use the 16 Vdc RMS current ratings for filtered power supply and battery AH calculations. Use the 16 Vfwr RMS current ratings for unfiltered power supply calculations.   
5.	 Fuses, circuit breakers and other overcurrent protection devices are typically rated for current in RMS values. Most of these devices operate based upon the heating affect of the current flowing through the device. The RMS current determines the heating affect and therefore, the trip and hold threshold for those devices.

# Installation and Mounting  

All models fit to a standard flush mounted, North American four inch electrical box, 1-1/2 inch $(38\,\mathsf{m m})$ deep minimum. Optional EDWARDS weatherproof, surface mount boxes are available. The strobes must be connected to signal circuits which output a constant (not pulsed) voltage. EDWARDS recommends that these strobes always be installed in accordance with the latest recognized edition of national and local fire alarm codes.
