# Sealed Lead-Acid Batteries  

# Overview  

Rechargeable sealed lead-acid batteries are ideal for use as a secondary (standby) power source as defined by NFPA 72. Their low maintenance and high energy density make them ideal for fire alarm signaling applications.  

# Standard Features  

•Rechargeable •	 Non-spillable •Non-hazardous •Low maintenance High energy density  

# Application  

When multiple power supplies are provided, each power supply’s battery requirements should be calculated individually. Consult the specific system manual to determine battery capacity requirements.  

# Safety Information  

Due to a battery’s low internal resistance and high power density, high levels of short circuit current can develop across battery terminals. Put on protective eye covering and remove all jewelry before working on batteries. Do not rest tools or cables on the battery, and only use insulated tools. Follow all manufacturers installation instructions and diagrams when installing or maintaining batteries.
