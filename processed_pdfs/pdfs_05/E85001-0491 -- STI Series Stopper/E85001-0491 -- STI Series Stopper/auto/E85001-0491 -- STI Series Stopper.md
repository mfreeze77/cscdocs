# STI Series Stopper® II  

# Overview  

This unique and patented device helps to prevent false fire alarms without restricting legitimate alarms. It consists of a tamper-proof, clear Lexan polycarbonate shield and frame that fits easily over manual pull stations. When lifted to gain access to the actual alarm, it sounds a piercing warning horn. Immediate attention is drawn to the pull station and a prankster will run or be caught. Legitimate alarms can still be pulled.  

Use proven in thousands of applications around the worldincluding colleges, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, correctional institutions, hotels/motels and stores.

# Dimensions  

# Size of Pull Station Accommodated  

The Stopper II can be installed over a flush-mounted station up to $5\%$ inches (140mm) wide $\times\,6\%$ inches (171mm) high. However, the pull station’s maximum dimensions will decrease as its depth (distance from wall) increases. e.g.:  

$3\%$ inch (19mm) deep pull station may be 5 inches (140mm) wide x 6 inches(152mm) high 1-5/8 inch (41mm) deep pull station may be 5 inches (127mm) wide x 6 inches (152mm) high 2-3/8 inch (60mm) deep pull station may be 4 inches (102mm) wide $x\,5$ inches(146mm) high 2 inch (70mm) deep pull station may be 3 inches (76mm) wide $\times\,5$ inches (140mm) high NOTE: If additional depth is needed, use the Conduit Spacer (Part No. STI 3100) which adds 2 inches (51mm) to the depth.  

# Patent Approval  

Stopper II has received patent approval from the United States (No. 4267549) and Canada (No. 1147828Z). Patents for other countries are pending.  

# Mounting  

Two types of mounting are available. Flush-mounted means the pull station is mounted directly on the wall. Surface-mounted means the pull station is mounted on an electrical box away from the wall.  

Surface Mounted: When the pull station is mounted on an electrical box away from the wall, order Part No. STI 1130 (with horn) or Part No. STI 1230 (without horn). Each includes longer screws with anchors and a 2 inch (51mm) conduit spacer (Part No. STI 3100) with knockouts top and bottom to accommodate the conduit pipe.  

# For Added Weatherproofing  

Install gasket (STI 3002) between Stopper Il frame and wall. A second gasket must be installed behind the spacer for surface mounting. A conduit gasket (STI 3003) may be used to seal the conduit pipe.
