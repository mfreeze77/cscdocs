# Detector Mounting Plate SIGA-DMP  

# Overview  

The SIGA-DMP Detector Mounting Plate is part of the Signature Series family. It is a 7 inch (178mm) square mounting plate designed to provide convenient mounting of Signature Series intelligent smoke detectors in raised floor or plenum applications. The detector mounting plate may also be installed in low velocity ducts that have a maximum width of up to 36 inches (915mm) and a maximum height of up to 36 inches (915mm). It includes a 4 inch square junction box for wiring connections.  

The SIGA-DMP is compatible with the following Signature Series smoke detectors and detector mounting bases:  

•	 SIGA-PD Intelligent Photoelectric Smoke Detector   
•	 SIGA-PHD Intelligent Photoelectric and Heat Detector   
•SIGA2-PS Intelligent Photoelectric Smoke Detector SIGA-PS Intelligent Photoelectric Smoke Detector   
•SIGA2-PHS Intelligent 3D Multisensor Smoke Detector   
•SIGA-PHS Intelligent 3D Multisensor Smoke Detector SIGA-IPHS Intelligent 4D Multisensor Smoke Detector   
•	 SIGA-SB Standard Base; SIGA-RB Relay Base   
•	 SIGA-IB Isolator Base.  

Mounting hardware is included along with a drilling template and rubber gasket which forms air tight seal between the mounting plate and the mounting surface. The complete assembly is finished in red epoxy powder coat for maximum durability and easy identification.

# Application  

The SIGA-DMP may be installed in any of three possible configurations.  

Installation Option #1: In applications in which the SIGA-DMP is mounted in a clearly visible location, a remote LED (model SIGALED) may be mounted directly to the SIGA-DMP to indicate Alarm conditions of the smoke detector.  

Installation Option #2: In applications in which an intelligent control relay module (model SIGA-CR) is mounted directly to the SIGA-DMP, a remote LED (model SIGA-LED) must be mounted at a remote location to provide indication of Alarm conditions of the smoke detector.  

Installation Option #3: In applications in which the SIGA-DMP is not located in a clearly visible location, a remote LED (model SIGALED) must be mounted at a remote location to provide indication of Alarm conditions to the smoke detector.
