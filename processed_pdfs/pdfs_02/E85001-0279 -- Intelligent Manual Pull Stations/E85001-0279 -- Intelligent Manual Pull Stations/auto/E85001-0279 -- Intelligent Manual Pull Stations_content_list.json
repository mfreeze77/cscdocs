The SIGA-270 Fire Alarm Manual Pull Stations feature our very familiar teardrop shape. They are made from die-cast zinc and finished with red epoxy powdercoat paint complemented by aluminum colored stripes and markings.  With positive pull-lever operation, one pull on the station handle breaks the glass rod and turns in a positive alarm, ensuring protection plus fool-proof operation. Presignal models (SIGA-270P) are equipped with a general alarm (GA) keyswitch for applications where two stage operation is required. The up-front highly visible glass rod discourages tampering, but is not required for proper operation. ",
