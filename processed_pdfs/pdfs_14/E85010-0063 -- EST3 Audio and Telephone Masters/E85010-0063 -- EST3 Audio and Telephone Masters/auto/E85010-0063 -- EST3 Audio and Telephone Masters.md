# Audio and Telephone Masters 3-ASU series  

# Overview  

The efficient EST3 audio system provides for intuitive local and remote audio control for Mass Notification/Emergency Communications (MNEC), Life Safety and other approved uses. EST3 audio builds from standard modules that fit together easily. Audio components use standard EST3 cabinets and power supplies.  

Taking full advantage of digital technology, up to eight channels of audio sources transmit over a single twisted pair of wires or fiber optic cables between nodes. Coupling the inherent reliability and performance of zoned amplifiers with EST3 simplified user interfaces makes audio system design and operation easy and dependable.  

The 3-ASU is seamlessly integrated into an EST3 system to provide for a rugged and reliable communications package that can be configured for Mass Notification/Emergency Communication (MNEC), as well as fire alarm and other emergency functions. The 3-ASU audio source unit supports eight channels of clear digital audio that is easily distributed to panels containing 3-ZA rail amplifiers. The 3-ASU supports digital storage and playback of prerecorded messages as well as live paging. The optional 3-FTCU provides a unique, space-saving and easy-to-operate control point for dedicated emergency/firefighter two-way telephones.

# Application  

EST3 audio is accomplished by selecting modular components for installation in standard fire alarm cabinet assemblies. At the main control panel location mounting audio control equipment provides an emergency user interface for “Paging” and optionally a “Firefighters Master Telephone”. Zoned amplifiers mount in the main control panel and/or in remote nodes. By mounting amplifiers in remote nodes, wire runs and space requirements are reduced at the main control panel.  

The heart of the EST3 audio package is the Audio Source Unit (ASU). The Audio Source unit converts analog signals to digital signals. On board audio memory stores signal tones and/or alarmalert verbal messages.  

These digitally-stored messages can be recorded onsite using standard PC audio components or downloaded from a library of pre-recorded messages and tones. Messages can be in any language or combination of languages. The ASU comes standard with two minutes of memory for tone and message storage. Available message memory expands easily to 100 minutes with the optional 3-ASUMX/100 memory expansion card.  

Audio Source units support connection of a local microphone, remote microphone, telephone voice line , and Mass Notification/ Emergency Communication (MNEC) audio feed. With eight audio channels to choose from combinations of paging, alert, evacuation signaling and automatic messages are available for simultaneous delivery to different parts of a building or to different buildings.  

There are two main audio user interface modules: the paging microphone, and the firefighter’s telephone, which supports threestate and four-state firefighter telephones. Available individually or in a set, EST3 audio modules open system design possibilities.  

When the Life Safety system requires paging only the 3-ASU or 3-ASU/4 Audio Source Units provides a Master Paging microphone with common controls. Switch labeling makes the operation intuitive. Six LEDs and five switches cover paging operations. Three of the five paging switches, All Call, Page to Evacuation, and Page to Alert, cover most paging operations. A VU display shows the user the output level of the page in process. The 3-ASU series mount in one chassis space of a EST3 Lobby enclosure. In addition to the paging microphone the 3-ASU/4 has mounting space for up to four local rail modules, including 20, 40, and 95 watt zone amplifiers and up to four Control Display modules allowing layout flexibility. The 3-ASU provides the same functionality as the 3-ASU/4 but is supplied with an inner door filler plate and no local rail module spaces.

# Paging Microphone  

Ready-to-Page LED turns on after the   
pre-announce tone has finished indicating the system is ready to page.   
All Call selects all amplifiers for page   
delivery.   
Page to EVAC selects all amplifiers currently delivering evacuation signaling for page delivery.   
Page to ALERT selects all amplifiers   
currently delivering alert signaling for page delivery.  

All Call Minus selects all amplifiers not programmed for alarm signaling for page delivery (typically stairwells).  

Page by Phone selects the telephone voice line as the paging source.  

Operating the Microphone Talk Key stops alarm signaling to selected zones and starts pre-announce tone delivery.  

When the pre-announce tone finishes, the Ready to Page LED turns on.  

When system design calls for paging with Firefighters telephone the 3-ASU/FT provides all the paging features of the 3-ASU series with the added benefit of a master handset assembly. The 3-ASU/ FT brings to the emergency user easy to understand switches and text messages displaying on a backlit $8\times20$ character LCD display.
