# EST4 Audio Units and Interfaces 4-MIC, 4-FT, 4-LCDAUDTEL  

# Overview  

Nothing connects with building occupants better than spoken words, and EST4’s highly intelligible voice audio ensures that those words are heard loud and clear. This high-fidelity messaging, across EST4’s impressive capacity of 200 channels, provides the flexibility needed to get messages out clearly and concisely.  

EST4’s voice audio function is built modularly from a collection of components finely tuned to the needs of small and large facilities alike. System designers can specify an ideal voice audio system by pinpointing the right components for the project, and selecting only equipment needed to get the job done. All audio components are standard modules that fit together easily. Each is an integrated part of EST4, allowing the use of the same cabinets, power supplies, and even network cabling as other EST4 components.  

EST4 microphones and telephone handsets, along with their controllers, are used to create Notification Control Areas (NCAs) that can contain one or more Command Centers. EST4 allows both mass notification and emergency communications to be addressed, delivering live paging and pre-recorded messaging where its needed. EST4 supports configurations with Central Control Stations (CCSs), Autonomous Control Units (ACUs), and Local Operations Consoles (LOCs). Together, these options provide the opportunity to find an efficient yet economical Emergency Communications audio solution for any size installation.

# Application  

EST4 integrated audio is a modular group of components that install in standard fire alarm cabinet assemblies. The Audio Command Center, which holds audio control equipment, provides an emergency user interface for live and recorded paging, and optionally, a firefighters’ master telephone or microphone. Zoned amplifiers mount in the main control panel or in remote cabinets, allowing distribution of the system, reducing the need to home run speaker wiring. Remote cabinets are easy to install because only a single twisted pair is required between cabinets, carrying not only audio, but network data and firefighters’ telephone audio as well.  

EST4 goes beyond standard emergency systems, ensuring that audio can provide the resources needed to cover the applications of even the largest and complex life safety applications. EST4 supports connection of local and network microphones, multiple telephone voice lines, and Mass Notification audio. It also expands the potential of these capabilities with 200 audio voice channels – an industry first. In fact, up to 100 audio channels per NCA support any combination of eight channels at the panel. These 100 channels for Paging, Alert, Evacuation signalling and automatic messages are delivered simultaneously to the parts of a building or buildings that need the information.  

# Efficient deployment  

EST4 supports high fidelity digital audio, providing intelligibility that is not compromised at any point in the system. A dramatically simplified interconnect architecture handles up to 100 audio channels per NCA, and audio data can be transmitted over the same inter-panel cabling as other EST4 data. This means that paging, firefighters’ telephone, and panel data can all share the same cable – significantly reducing project material expenses and installation labor costs for new installations and allowing audio to be added to many retrofit applications without the need of additional cables.  

EST4 audio applications benefit from the inherent reliability and performance of zoned amplifiers, along with simplified user interface options, network interconnection flexibility, and several layers of survivability. All this combines to provide a flexible, cost-effective, and reliable audio solution.  

# Effective Control  

The 4-LCDAUDTEL LCD module provides a dedicated color touchscreen user interface option for selecting page circuits, and placing and receiving calls over the Firefighter Telephone Handset. The LCD module mounts to the inner door of cabinets or annunciators.  

LED-Switch Modules may be used exclusively for audio control, or used in conjunction with the LCD user interface. These modules offer convenient slide-in strips for custom and color-coded labeling. Switch modules provide both tactile and visual feedback when a switch selection is made, offering instant verification that the command has been received by the system.  

The 4-MIC Microphone assembly works with LED-Switch modules and the LCD touch-screen user interface. It also comes standard with a VU volume level that shows the signal level provided by the microphone during the page process.  

# Survivable Distributed Audio  

EST4’s true distributed audio ensures the survivability of emergency messaging functions even in the face of catastrophic events. All pre-recorded messages are stored at the control panel, and programmed audio channel selection is made locally as well. This means that programmed messages will become active when a locally generated alarm is initiated — even if a network failure has occurred. Zoned amplifiers also have integrated 1000 Hz temporal tone generators that will produce a backup signal should the control panel CPU go offline. For additional system redundancy, a single standby amplifier can back up any zoned amplifier installed in the same cabinet.  

Network wiring can also be configured in several ways to bolster the survivability of live paging and event notification throughout the network. These layers of redundancy provide audio system survivability that keeps life safety measures in place. There is no need to rely on network data transmissions of pre-recorded messaging. The panel always plays the message for events based on the event. This ensures fast selection and reliable playback even under the harshest conditions.  

# Uncomplicated Plug-and-Play Configuration  

Adding a microphone or firefighters’ telephone at any EST4 control panel is as easy as plugging in a module. The 4-AUDTELS and 4-ANNAUDTEL interface modules mount to the back of the 4-CPU main processor unit or to a 4-ANNCPU annunciator CPU. The interface modules accept connections from locally-mounted microphones or telephones. Pre-recorded messages are stored at each panel that have zone amplifiers so there is no need to have a microphone or telephone at every panel. Nonetheless, EST4 does support multiple paging microphone masters and fire fighter telephone masters with programmable request-grant-deny function. This ensures that messaging is provided by those in control of the system.  

# Audio Components  

# 4-AUDTELS Audio-Telephone Interface Module  

The 4-AUDTELS enables and processes information from connected microphone or telephone units mounted directly to the right of the CPU. The 4-AUDTELS also provides audio input-output, and is the source for a telephone riser that supports remote handsets and up to four line-level balanced audio input/output connections are available.  

The four balanced audio connections can be individually programmed as inputs or outputs, each rated for 1 Vrms nominal signal level. Multiple 4-AUDTELS may be installed in an EST4 network, providing support for multiple telephone riser applications and multiple low-level audio inputs/ outputs.  

# 4-ANNAUDTEL Annunciator, Audio, and Telephone Interface Module  

The 4-ANNAUDTEL mounts to the top of the 4-ANNCPU. The 4-ANNAUDTEL enables and processes information from connected microphone or telephone units. The module mounts in remote annunciators as well as in lobby cabinets.

# 4-LCDAUDTEL LCD Display Module for Audio and Telephone Control  

The optional 4-LCDAUDTEL LCD module provides a dedicated color touch-screen user interface for selecting page circuits and for placing and receiving calls over the Firefighters’ Telephone Handset. The LCD module mounts to the inner door of cabinets or annunciators. The interface does not have common control push buttons. The 4-LCDAUDTEL touch screen LCD may be used as the only method of making audio and telephone selections, or it may be used in combination with LED-Switch modules.  

For a complete list of LCD options please see the Ordering Information table.  

# 4-MIC - Paging Microphone  

The 4-MIC paging microphone mounts to the inner door of cabinets and annunciators, taking only two spaces. The 4-MIC is easy to use. It provides a hand-held microphone with push-to-talk switch and a multi-color amber-green-red volume meter on the assembly. The 4-MIC can be used for general alarm paging. Where no zoning is needed, simply pick up the mic, press the push-to-talk switch, and make the page to the entire system. Use an LED-Switch Module or 4-LCDAUDTEL color touch-screen interface where zoning or specific messaging operations are needed.

# 4-FT - Firefighter Master Handset  

The 4-FT firefighter master handset mounts to the inner door of cabinets and annunciators, taking only two spaces. The 4-FT is used in conjunction with the 4-AUDTELS or 4-ANNAUDTEL interface modules. The 4-AUDTELS provides a firefighter telephone riser connection for remote warden stations. Telephone call-in selection may be annunciated at the control center via standard EST4 LED-Switch modules or the 4-LCDAUDTEL color touch-screen. Where multiple command centers are deployed, EST4 easily configures for request-grant-deny operation, ensuring that one command center is in control at one time, but allowing for changes in control if required.
