LED indicators are actually comprised of five individual LEDs, each of a different color. Programmers configure indicators to display their pre-selected color according to the type of information conveyed by the indicator. This offers a level of design efficiency that can reduce the number of display strips necessary for an application. In addition to color selection, the flash rate of the LED may be programmed to provide even more information. Examples include: damper and fan status, or audio zone notification status, alert, evaluation or paging. ",
