The most vulnerable point of contact for any integrated building system is where it meets the facility owner’s existing TCP/IP network. Ironically it is this gateway, which enhances and expands system capability beyond the communications network, that also exposes the system to some of its most critical vulnerabilities. 4-FWAL Series firewalls mitigate those vulnerabilities by providing a barrier between the EST4 life safety platform and the external connections necessary in today’s networked building infrastructure.
