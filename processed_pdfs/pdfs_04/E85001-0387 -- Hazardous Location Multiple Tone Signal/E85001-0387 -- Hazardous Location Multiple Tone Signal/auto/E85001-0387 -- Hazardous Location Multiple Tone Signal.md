# Hazardous Location Multiple Tone Signal 5533BD  

# Overview  

The EDWARDS 5533BD signal is a heavy-duty industrial, tone-selectable, signaling device capable of producing volume-controlled, high-decibel tones. The signal delivers one audible output signal selected from the 19 available tones. The tone is selected by setting a miniature switch on the unit.  

# Standard Features  

•	 Diode polarized for field wiring supervision   
•	 19 tone capability – no additional tone modules needed   
•	 Four three-pulse temporal tones   
•	 Internal volume control   
•	 One Input, one output   
•	 Corrosion-resistant heat flowed epoxy finish  

# Application  

The 5533BD signal is intended for use in fire alarm systems and other applications that require electrical supervision of signal circuit field wiring, particularly where a high decibel sound is required for alert or evacuation in hazardous locations. Typical applications include signaling use in mining, granaries, flour mills, tankers, refineries, laboratories, spray booths, and other hazardous locations. The 5533BD signal is suitable for indoor applications only and is not weatherproof.  

# Installation  

5533BD signals mount with three bolts on any solid surface. To maximize effective signal direction, the trumpet can be swivelled through 180 degrees horizontally or 180 degrees vertically, depending on the orientation of the mounting yoke.  

All field wiring is made to tagged wire leads. Each unit is fitted with a sealed, threaded $\%$ -inch ( $13\;\mathrm{mm})$ fitting.
